                                                    odd or even
Aim:
   To find a given value is odd or even using C program

Algorithm:
             step:1 start the program
             step:2 read the value a
             step3: if a%2==0, the
             step:4 print the vaiue is even
             step:5 otherwise the vaiue is odd
             step:6 stop the Execution
